"# dashboard-mockup" https://paultan09.github.io/dashboard-mockup/


Dashboard mockup site using CSS Grid (and some flexbox here and there). The buttons and the project cards have hover + active animations - the links work too, but that's about it.

I tried to account for mobile devices as well, but I was limited to Firefox/Chromium's DevTools mobile aspect ratio presets.
